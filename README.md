# YelpCamp-App
YelpCamp is a user friendly app that allows its members to share their own camping experiences and also view the experiences of others. Once signed up and logged in, a user can upload a picture of the campground they visited along with a description of the site. Once uploaded, the user has the freedom to delete and edit the post. Other viewers who are logged in have the ability to comment on the post. They too have the freedom to edit or delete their own comment.
